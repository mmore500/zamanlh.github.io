short_blurb: "Bhaskar is a PhD student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. He graduated from the Indian Institute of Science with a BS+MS dual degree in 2021. He is broadly interested in studying living systems using theoretical tools under the umbrella of complex systems and has formal undergraduate training in biology, with special emphasis on molecular biology and systems theory. Most of his research until now has been either on engineering biological systems (synthetic biology) or studying their equivalents in artificial environments (artificial life). He is currently working to understand how complexity evolves in living systems and how evolving entities become more evolvable."
