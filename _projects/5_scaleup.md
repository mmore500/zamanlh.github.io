title: Scaling Up Digital Evolution Experiments
blurb: "This project aims to harness the power of next-generation AI hardware accelerators for large-scale agent-based modeling and simulation. By developing new algorithms for efficient data management and observation, researchers will enable simulations of unprecedented scale and complexity. While the project will use epidemiological modeling as a test case, its core advances in computational methods have the potential to impact a wide range of scientific fields that rely on complex simulations. The work will demonstrate how emerging hardware architectures can be leveraged to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in computational science."
