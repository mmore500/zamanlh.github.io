title: Reversing Rate Adaptation
subtitle: "We've recently started using emulsion populations in the lab, where cells are distributed into millions of isolated media droplets surrounded by an immiscible oil phase. For our first project with these emulsions, we're testing how selection reverses thousands of generations of adaptation to an environment favoring faster and faster growth -- Richard Lenski's LTEE."
