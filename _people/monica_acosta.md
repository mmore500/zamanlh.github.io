short_blurb: "Monica is an evolutionary biologist who is most fascinated by pathogens, both for their complex lifestyles and the insights they provide on basic evolutionary processes. She completed her doctorate from Pennsylvania State University in the Fall of 2019 where she worked on understanding how various aspects of antimicrobial drug therapy affect the evolution of drug resistance by pathogens. While working on her doctorate she became interested in better understanding what drives the rapid evolution of parasites. She is currently interested in using experiments with digital organisms to further explore what types of environments promote or hinder pathogen evolution."
