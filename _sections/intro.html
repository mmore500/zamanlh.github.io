  <h2>Welcome to The <strong>Zaman E<sup>3</sup></strong> Lab</h2>
  <h4 class="alt"><strong>E</strong>ngineered and <strong>E</strong>xperimental <strong>E</strong>volution</h4>
</br>
<p>Much of our work focuses on host-parasite coevolution both <u>computationally</u> using populations of self-replicating computer programs (sort of like computer viruses), and <u>experimentally</u> in the lab with bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophage). But that's not all! We're deeply interdisciplinary, and broadly interested in ecology and evolution. </p>
