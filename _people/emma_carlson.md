short_blurb: "Emma is a 2nd year PhD student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department. She graduated from University of Minnesota (go gophers!) with a BS in Plant and Microbial Biology in 2020. She is currently interested in biofilm-phage interactions and how niche co-construction impacts short and long term coevolutionary dynamics. She is interested in applying these ideas to both medical (phage therapy) and agricultural (plant growth promoting bacteria) systems. She also enjoys science communication, contaminating her stock media, and chatting with her lab mates."
