short_blurb: "Katie Torkelson-Regan is an environmental science teacher at Washtenaw Technical Middle College in Ann Arbor, MI. Over the summer of 2018, she worked in the lab as an RET student and did research on the cost of resistance in parasite-host populations. Outside of evolutionary biology, she loves ecology and conservation biology-- anything that helps her learn about the systems of the natural world and deepens her appreciation for it! As a teacher, Katie's passions are teaching students about sustainability and helping students see themselves as scientists. When she's not teaching or learning about biology, Katie gardens, hikes, knits, listens to podcasts, and drinks coffee."
