          Although my academic life started in computer science, my research interests are centered around evolutionary biology. I once heard the kinds of approaches I'm interested in described as "undisciplined science," and I'm quite fond of that phrasing.

          At the end of The Origin of Species, Charles Darwin highlighted the mutual dependence between organisms by inviting his reader to imagine a “tangled bank,” chocked full of interacting plants and animals. The goal of my research is to answer the question: How does evolution proceed in such a tangled bank?
